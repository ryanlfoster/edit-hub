Created by: Mandi Wise
Info: http://mandiwise.com/
License: GNU General Public License v2.0 (excluding icons)

Requires at least: 3.2.1

== Description ==

Edit Hub turns a basic WordPress installation into a centralized location to organize your content and related media assets, facilitate collaborative content development, maintain an editorial calendar, and export content into a variety of useful formats when required.

Edit Hub was designed with communications professionals of all stripes in mind, but business owners, project managers, and just about anyone faced with the prospect of creating, refining, and publishing content will find it helpful — especially when the development of this content requires collaboration with others.

== Features ==

* An "Overview" page template to serve as your home base for monintoring editorial activity along with important dates and deadlines
* Three custom taxonomies for organizing and filtering your content posts, including "Content Channel" and "Audience" (hierarchical) and "Keywords" (non-hierarchical)
* Export actions for content posts (email, print, export as text, and export as HTML)
* An "Events Calendar" custom post type with corresponding "Event Category" custom taxonomy
* Two page templates for viewing events — a loop of upcoming events displayed chronologically with details, as well as a month-at-a-glance, grid-style events calendar
* A comprehensive archives page template
* Support for WordPress menus, thus making customization of Edit Hub's main site navigation menu as easy as pie

== Plans for Later Releases of Edit Hub ==

Watch for the following features in future releases of Edit Hub:

* A theme options plan to allow you to easily customize the look and feel of Edit Hub to your tastes
* Expanded functionality of the Events Calendar custom post type, including an exportable calendar feed
* WordPress 3.3-ready contextual help throughout the Admin interface
* Further refinements and customizations to the Admin interface
* Improved in-site search

== Installation ==

For information on setting up a basic WordPress installation, please visit: http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress

To install the Edit Hub theme for the first time, select Appearance -> Themes in the left-hand menu in the WordPress admin interface. Next, select the Install Themes tab, and select Upload from its submenu. Locate and upload the Edit Hub theme zip file and activiate it.

Alternatively, you may also extract and upload the theme files directly to your wp-content folder using FTP, and then activate the Edit Hub theme on the Themes page in the WordPress admin interface.

== Recommended Plugins ==

To best optimize Edit Hub, please consider installing the following two plugins. Both have been tested extensively with the most current version of Edit Hub.

Edit Hub loves Edit Flow! From custom post statuses to editorial comments, the Edit Flow plugin for WordPress adds an additional level of customizable control to your content creation workflows. Get more info about Edit Flow here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/edit-flow/

= Absolute Privacy =

Want to password-protect your entire Edit Hub installation? Look no further than the Absolute Privacy plugin, which allows you to hide your Edit Hub site from public visibility and moderate new user registrations.
